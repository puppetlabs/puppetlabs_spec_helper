Puppet Labs Spec Helper
=======================

The Short Version
-----------------

This repository is meant to provide a single source of truth for how to
initialize different Puppet versions for spec testing.

The common use case is a module such as
[stdlib](http://forge.puppetlabs.com/puppetlabs/stdlib) that works with many
versions of Puppet.  The stdlib module should require the spec helper in this
repository, which will in turn automatically figure out the version of Puppet
being tested against and perform version specific initialization.

Other "customers" that should use this module are:

 * [Facter](https://github.com/puppetlabs/facter)
 * [PuppetDB](https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetdb)
 * [Mount Providers](https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-mount_providers)

Usage
=====

When developing or testing modules, simply clone this repository and install the
gem it contains. The recommended way to do this is using [bundler](http://bundler.io/#getting-started).

Example Gemfile:

    source 'https://rubygems.org'
    gem 'puppetlabs_spec_helper'

Add this to your project's spec\_helper.rb:

    require 'puppetlabs_spec_helper/module_spec_helper'

Add this to your project's Rakefile:

    require 'puppetlabs_spec_helper/rake_tasks'

And run the spec tests:

    $ cd $modulename
    $ rake spec


### Parallel Fixture Downloads
Fixture downloads will now execute in parallel to speed up the testing process. Which can represent >= 600% speed increase (depending on number of threads). You can control the amount of threads by setting the `MAX_FIXTURE_THREAD_COUNT` environment variable
to a positive integer, the default is currently 10.  We don't suggest going higher than 25 as the gains are marginal due to some repos taking a long time to download.  Please be aware that your internal VCS system may not be able to handle a high load in which case the server would fail to clone the repository. Because of this issue, this setting is tunable via `MAX_FIXTURE_THREAD_COUNT`.

Additionally, you can also speed up cloning when using the ssh protocol by multiplexing ssh sessions.  Add something similar to your ssh config.
Note: you may need to change the host if your using an internal git server.

```shell
Host github.com
  ControlMaster auto
  ControlPath ~/.ssh/ssh-%r@%h:%p
  ControlPersist yes

```

Note: parallel downloads is only available for repositories and not forge modules.

The Long Version
----------------

Purpose of this Project
=======================

This project is intended to serve two purposes:

1. To serve as a bridge between external projects and multiple versions of puppet;
   in other words, if your project has a dependency on puppet, you shouldn't need
   to need to worry about the details of how to initialize puppet's state for
   testing, no matter what version of puppet you are testing against.
2. To provide some convenience classes / methods for doing things like creating
   tempfiles, common rspec matchers, etc.  These classes are in the puppetlabs\_spec
   directory.
3. To provide a common set of Rake tasks so that the procedure for testing modules
   is unified.

To Use this Project
===================

The most common usage scenario is that you will check out the 'master'
branch of this project from github, and install it as a rubygem.
There should be few or no cases where you would want to have any other
branch of this project besides master/HEAD.

Initializing Puppet for Testing
===============================

In most cases, your project should be able to define a spec\_helper.rb that includes
just this one simple line:

    require 'puppetlabs_spec_helper/puppet_spec_helper'

Then, as long as the gem is installed, you should be all set.

If you are using rspec-puppet for module testing, you will want to include a different
library:

    require 'puppetlabs_spec_helper/module_spec_helper'

NOTE that this is specifically for initializing Puppet's core.  If your project does
not have any dependencies on puppet and you just want to use the utility classes,
see the next section.

A number of the Puppet parser features, controlled via configuration during a
normal puppet run, can be controlled by exporting specific environment
variables for the spec run. These are:

* ``FUTURE_PARSER`` - set to "yes" to enable the [future parser](http://docs.puppetlabs.com/puppet/latest/reference/experiments_future.html),
  the equivalent of setting [parser=future](http://docs.puppetlabs.com/references/latest/configuration.html#parser)
  in puppet.conf.
* ``STRICT_VARIABLES`` - set to "no" to disable strict variable checking when using Puppet >= 4.0,
  the equivalent of not setting [strict_variables](http://docs.puppetlabs.com/references/latest/configuration.html#strictvariables)
  in puppet.conf.
* ``ORDERING`` - set to the desired ordering method ("title-hash", "manifest", or "random")
  to set the order of unrelated resources when applying a catalog. Leave unset for the default
  behavior, currently "random". This is equivalent to setting [ordering](http://docs.puppetlabs.com/references/latest/configuration.html#ordering)
  in puppet.conf.
* ``STRINGIFY_FACTS`` - set to "no" to enable [structured facts](http://docs.puppetlabs.com/facter/2.0/fact_overview.html#writing-structured-facts),
  otherwise leave unset to retain the current default behavior. This is equivalent to setting
  [stringify_facts=false](http://docs.puppetlabs.com/references/latest/configuration.html#stringifyfacts)
  in puppet.conf.
* ``TRUSTED_NODE_DATA`` - set to "yes" to enable [the $facts hash and trusted node data](http://docs.puppetlabs.com/puppet/latest/reference/lang_facts_and_builtin_vars.html),
  which enabled ``$facts`` and ``$trusted`` hashes. This is equivalent to setting
  [trusted_node_data=true](http://docs.puppetlabs.com/references/latest/configuration.html#trustednodedata)
  in puppet.conf.

As an example, to run spec tests with the future parser, strict variable checking,
and manifest ordering, you would:

    FUTURE_PARSER=yes STRICT_VARIABLES=yes ORDERING=manifest rake spec

When executing tests in a matrix CI environment, tests can be split up to run
a share of specs per CI node in parallel.  Set the ``CI_NODE_TOTAL`` environment
variable to the total number of nodes, and the ``CI_NODE_INDEX`` to a number
between 1 and the ``CI_NODE_TOTAL``.

If using Travis CI, add new lines to the "env" section of .travis.yml per node,
remembering to duplicate any existing environment variables:

    env:
      - FUTURE_PARSER=yes CI_NODE_TOTAL=2 CI_NODE_INDEX=1
      - FUTURE_PARSER=yes CI_NODE_TOTAL=2 CI_NODE_INDEX=2

Using Utility Classes
=====================
If you'd like to use the Utility classes (PuppetlabsSpec::Files,
PuppetlabsSpec::Fixtures), you just need to add this to your project's spec\_helper.rb:

    require 'puppetlabs_spec_helper/puppetlabs_spec_helper'

NOTE that the above line happens automatically if you've required
'puppetlabs\_spec\_helper/puppet\_spec\_helper', so you don't need to do both.

In either case, you'll have all of the functionality of Puppetlabs::Files,
Puppetlabs::Fixtures, etc., mixed-in to your rspec context.

Using Fixtures
==============
`puppetlabs_spec_helper` has the ability to populate the
`spec/fixtures/modules` directory with dependent modules when `rake spec` or
`rake spec_prep` is run. To do so, all required modules should be listed in a
file named `.fixtures.yml` in the root of the project.

When specifying the repo source of the fixture you have a few options as to which revision of the codebase you wish to use.

 * repo - the url to the repo
 * scm - options include git or hg. This is an optional step as the helper code will figure out which scm is used.
   ```yaml
   scm: git
   scm: hg
   ```
 * target - the directory name to clone the repo into ie. `target: mymodule`  defaults to the repo name  (Optional)
 * ref - used to specify the tag name like version hash of commit (Optional)
   ```yaml
   ref: 1.0.0
   ref: 880fca52c
   ```
 * branch - used to specify the branch name you want to use ie. `branch: development`
 * flags - additional flags passed to the module installer (both puppet and scm)
   ```yaml
   flags: --verbose
   ```

 **Note:** ref and branch can be used together to get a specific revision on a specific branch

Fixtures Examples
-----------------
Basic fixtures that will symlink `spec/fixtures/modules/my_modules` to the
project root:

    fixtures:
      symlinks:
        my_module: "#{source_dir}"


Add `firewall` and `stdlib` as required module fixtures:

    fixtures:
      repositories:
        firewall: "git://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-firewall"
        stdlib: "git://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-stdlib"
      symlinks:
        my_module: "#{source_dir}"

Specify that the git tag `2.4.2` of `stdlib' should be checked out:

    fixtures:
      repositories:
        firewall: "git://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-firewall"
        stdlib:
          repo: "git://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-stdlib"
          ref: "2.6.0"
      symlinks:
        my_module: "#{source_dir}"

Install modules from Puppet Forge:

    fixtures:
        forge_modules:
            firewall: "puppetlabs/firewall"
            stdlib:
                repo: "puppetlabs/stdlib"
                ref: "2.6.0"

Pass additional flags to module installation:

    fixtures:
        forge_modules:
            stdlib:
                repo: "puppetlabs/stdlib"
                ref: "2.6.0"
                flags: "--module_repository https://my_repo.com"
        repositories:
            firewall:
                repo: "git://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-firewall"
                ref: "2.6.0"
                flags: "--verbose"

Testing Parser Functions
========================

This library provides a consistent way to create a Puppet::Parser::Scope object
suitable for use in a testing harness with the intent of testing the expected
behavior of parser functions distributed in modules.

Previously, modules would do something like this:

    describe "split()" do
      let(:scope) { Puppet::Parser::Scope.new }
      it "should split 'one;two' on ';' into [ 'one', 'two' ]" do
        scope.function_split(['one;two', ';']).should == [ 'one', 'two' ]
      end
    end

This will not work beyond Puppet 2.7 as we have changed the behavior of the
scope initializer in Puppet 3.0.  Modules should instead initialize scope
instances in a manner decoupled from the internal behavior of Puppet:

    require 'puppetlabs_spec_helper/puppetlabs_spec/puppet_internals'
    describe "split()" do
      let(:scope) { PuppetlabsSpec::PuppetInternals.scope }
      it "should split 'one;two' on ';' into [ 'one', 'two' ]" do
        scope.function_split(['one;two', ';']).should == [ 'one', 'two' ]
      end
    end

Generating code coverage reports
================================

This section describes how to add code coverage reports for Ruby files (types, providers, ...).
See the documentation of [RSpec-Puppet](https://github.com/rodjek/rspec-puppet)
for Puppet manifest coverage reports.

Starting with Ruby 1.9, the *de facto* standard for Ruby code coverage is
[SimpleCov](https://github.com/colszowka/simplecov).
You can add it to your module like this:

```Ruby
# First line of spec/spec_helper.rb
require 'simplecov'

SimpleCov.start do
  add_filter '/spec/'
  # Exclude bundled Gems in `/.vendor/`
  add_filter '/.vendor/'
end

require 'puppetlabs_spec_helper/module_spec_helper'
# Further content
```

The reports will then be generated every time you invoke RSpec, e.g. via `rake spec`,
and are written to `/coverage/`, which you should add to `.gitignore`.

Remember to add `gem 'simplecov', require: false` to your `Gemfile`.

Using Code Climate
------------------

You can also use [Code Climate](https://codeclimate.com/) together with SimpleCov:

```Ruby
# First line of spec/spec_helper.rb
require 'codeclimate-test-reporter'

SimpleCov.formatters = [
  SimpleCov::Formatter::HTMLFormatter,
  CodeClimate::TestReporter::Formatter
]

SimpleCov.start do
  add_filter '/spec/'
  # Exclude bundled Gems in `/.vendor/`
  add_filter '/.vendor/'
end

require 'puppetlabs_spec_helper/module_spec_helper'
# Further content
```

Remember to add `gem 'codeclimate-test-reporter', require: false` to your `Gemfile`.

Using Coveralls
---------------

You can also use [Coveralls](https://coveralls.io/) together with SimpleCov:

```Ruby
# First line of spec/spec_helper.rb
require 'simplecov'
require 'coveralls'

SimpleCov.formatters = [
  SimpleCov::Formatter::HTMLFormatter,
  Coveralls::SimpleCov::Formatter
]

SimpleCov.start do
  add_filter '/spec/'
  # Exclude bundled Gems in `/.vendor/`
  add_filter '/.vendor/'
end

require 'puppetlabs_spec_helper/module_spec_helper'
# Further content
```

Remember to add `gem 'coveralls', require: false` to your `Gemfile`.

Some Notes for Windows Users
============================

A windows users may need to do one of two things to execute `rake spec`.

Although things may appear to work, the init.pp may not transfer to the fixtures folder as needed
or may transfer as an empty file.

This is related to a registry security setting requiring elevated privileges to create symbolic links.

Currently, there are two known approaches to get around this problem.

- run your windows shell (cmd) as an Administrator  
or
- modify the registry entry settings to allow symbolic links to be created.

The following links may give you some insight into why...
