# Resource API hands-on lab

The Resource API hands-on lab walks you through creating a native integration with Puppet. After completing this lab, you will have a fully functioning module to manage Philips HUE lights.

>Note: These labs are intended for both new and experienced developers. If you have any feedback or suggestions for improvement, post it in the [issues section](https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppet-resource_api/issues).

To start with, we'll go through [installing Puppet Development Kit](./hands-on-lab/01-installing-prereqs.md)(PDK).
