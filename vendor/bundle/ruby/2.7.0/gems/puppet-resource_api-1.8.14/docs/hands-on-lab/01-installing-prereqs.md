# Install Puppet Development Kit (PDK) and other tools

To start, install Puppet Development Kit (PDK), which provides all the necessary tools and libraries to build and test modules. We also recommend an emulator for the target device, a code editor with good Ruby and Puppet support, and git â€” a version control system to keep track of your progress.

1. [Download PDK](https://puppet.com/download-puppet-development-kit) on your platform of choice.

2. If you do not have a Philips HUE hub and bulbs available, you can download the [Hue-Emulator](https://github.com/SteveyO/Hue-Emulator/raw/master/HueEmulator-v0.8.jar). You need to have Java installed to run this.

3. To edit code, we recommend the cross-platform editor [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download), with the [Ruby](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=rebornix.Ruby) and [Puppet](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=puppet.puppet-vscode) extensions. There are lots of other extensions that can help you with your development workflow.

4. Git is a version control system that helps you keep track of changes and collaborate with others. As we go through hands-on lab, we will show you some integrations with cloud services. If you have never used git before, ignore this and all related steps.
