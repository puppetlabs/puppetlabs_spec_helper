#
# Local settings can be configured without being overwritten by package upgrades, for example
# if you want to increase puppet open-files-limit to 10000,
# you need to increase systemd's LimitNOFILE setting, so create a file named
# "/etc/systemd/system/puppet.service.d/limits.conf" containing:
# [Service]
# LimitNOFILE=10000
# You can confirm it worked by running systemctl daemon-reload
# then running systemctl show puppet | grep LimitNOFILE
