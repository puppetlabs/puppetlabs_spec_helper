# fileserver.conf

# Puppet automatically serves PLUGINS and FILES FROM MODULES: anything in
# <module name>/files/<file name> is available to authenticated nodes at
# puppet:///modules/<module name>/<file name>. You do not need to edit this
# file to enable this.

# MOUNT POINTS

# If you need to serve files from a directory that is NOT in a module,
# you must create a static mount point in this file:
#
# [extra_files]
#   path /etc/puppetlabs/puppet/files
#
# In the example above, anything in /etc/puppetlabs/puppet/files/<file name>
# would be available to authenticated nodes at puppet:///extra_files/<file name>.
#
# Mount points may also use three placeholders as part of their path:
#
# %H - The node's certname.
# %h - The portion of the node's certname before the first dot. (Usually the
#      node's short hostname.)
# %d - The portion of the node's certname after the first dot. (Usually the
#      node's domain name.)

# PERMISSIONS

# The ability to set permissions - for example, using the allow, allow_ip, or
# deny directives - has been removed from fileserver.conf. Instead, you can
# control file access in Puppet Server's auth.conf file. See the documentation
# at https://puppet.com/docs/puppetserver/latest/config_file_auth.html.
