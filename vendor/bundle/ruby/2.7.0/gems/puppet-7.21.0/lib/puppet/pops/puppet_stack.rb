module Puppet
  module Pops
    # Utility class for keeping track of the "Puppet stack", ie the file
    # and line numbers of Puppet Code that created the current context.
    #
    # To use this make a call with:
    #
    # ```rb
    # Puppet::Pops::PuppetStack.stack(file, line, receiver, message, args)
    # ```
    #
    # To get the stack call:
    #
    # ```rb
    # Puppet::Pops::PuppetStack.stacktrace
    # ```
    #
    # or
    #
    # ```rb
    # Puppet::Pops::PuppetStack.top_of_stack
    # ```
    #
    # To support testing, a given file that is an empty string, or nil
    # as well as a nil line number are supported. Such stack frames
    # will be represented with the text `unknown` and `0Â´ respectively.
