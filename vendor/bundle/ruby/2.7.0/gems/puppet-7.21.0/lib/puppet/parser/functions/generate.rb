    the results of the command. Any arguments are passed to the external command as
    arguments. If the generator does not exit with return code of 0,
    the generator is considered to have failed and a parse error is
    thrown. Generators can only have file separators, alphanumerics, dashes,
    and periods in them. This function will attempt to protect you from
    malicious generator calls (e.g., those with '..' in them), but it can
    never be entirely safe. No subshell is used to execute
    generators, so all shell metacharacters are passed directly to
    the generator, and all metacharacters are returned by the function.
    Consider cleaning white space from any string generated.") do |args|
