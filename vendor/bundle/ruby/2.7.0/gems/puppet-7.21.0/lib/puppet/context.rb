# Puppet::Context is a system for tracking services and contextual information
# that puppet needs to be able to run. Values are "bound" in a context when it is created
# and cannot be changed; however a child context can be created, using
# {#override}, that provides a different value.
#
# When binding a {Proc}, the proc is called when the value is looked up, and the result
# is memoized for subsequent lookups. This provides a lazy mechanism that can be used to
# delay expensive production of values until they are needed.
