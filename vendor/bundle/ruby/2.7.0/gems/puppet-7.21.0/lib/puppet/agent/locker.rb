# This module is responsible for encapsulating the logic for "locking" the
# puppet agent during a catalog run; in other words, keeping track of enough
# state to answer the question "is there a puppet agent currently applying a
# catalog?"
#
# The implementation involves writing a lockfile whose contents are simply the
# PID of the running agent process.  This is considered part of the public
# Puppet API because it used by external tools such as mcollective.
#
# For more information, please see docs on the website.
#  http://links.puppet.com/agent_lockfiles
module Puppet::Agent::Locker
  # Yield if we get a lock, else raise Puppet::LockError. Return
  # value of block yielded.
