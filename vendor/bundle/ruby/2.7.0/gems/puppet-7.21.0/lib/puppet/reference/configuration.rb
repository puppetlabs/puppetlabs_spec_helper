## Configuration settings

* Each of these settings can be specified in `puppet.conf` or on the
  command line.
* Puppet Enterprise (PE) and open source Puppet share the configuration settings
  documented here. However, PE defaults differ from open source defaults for some
  settings, such as `node_terminus`, `storeconfigs`, `always_retry_plugins`,
  `disable18n`, `environment_timeout` (when Code Manager is enabled), and the
  Puppet Server JRuby `max-active-instances` setting. To verify PE configuration
  defaults, check the `puppet.conf` or `pe-puppet-server.conf` file after
  installation.
* When using boolean settings on the command line, use `--setting` and
  `--no-setting` instead of `--setting (true|false)`. (Using `--setting false`
  results in "Error: Could not parse application options: needless argument".)
* Settings can be interpolated as `$variables` in other settings; `$environment`
  is special, in that puppet master will interpolate each agent node's
  environment instead of its own.
* Multiple values should be specified as comma-separated lists; multiple
  directories should be separated with the system path separator (usually
  a colon).
* Settings that represent time intervals should be specified in duration format:
  an integer immediately followed by one of the units 'y' (years of 365 days),
  'd' (days), 'h' (hours), 'm' (minutes), or 's' (seconds). The unit cannot be
  combined with other units, and defaults to seconds when omitted. Examples are
  '3600' which is equivalent to '1h' (one hour), and '1825d' which is equivalent
  to '5y' (5 years).
* If you use the `splay` setting, note that the period that it waits changes
  each time the Puppet agent is restarted.
* Settings that take a single file or directory can optionally set the owner,
  group, and mode for their value: `rundir = $vardir/run { owner = puppet,
  group = puppet, mode = 644 }`
* The Puppet executables ignores any setting that isn't relevant to
  their function.
