# Converts a String, Array or Hash (recursively) into lower case.
#
# This function is compatible with the stdlib function with the same name.
#
# The function does the following:
# * For a `String`, its lower case version is returned. This is done using Ruby system locale which handles some, but not all
#   special international up-casing rules (for example German double-s ß is upcased to "SS", whereas upper case double-s
#   is downcased to ß).
# * For `Array` and `Hash` the conversion to lower case is recursive and each key and value must be convertible by
#   this function.
# * When a `Hash` is converted, some keys could result in the same key - in those cases, the
#   latest key-value wins. For example if keys "aBC", and "abC" where both present, after downcase there would only be one
#   key "abc".
# * If the value is `Numeric` it is simply returned (this is for backwards compatibility).
# * An error is raised for all other data types.
#
# Please note: This function relies directly on Ruby's String implementation and as such may not be entirely UTF8 compatible.
# To ensure best compatibility please use this function with Ruby 2.4.0 or greater - https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/10085.
#
# @example Converting a String to lower case
# ```puppet
# 'HELLO'.downcase()
# downcase('HEllO')
# ```
# Would both result in `"hello"`
#
# @example Converting an Array to lower case
# ```puppet
# ['A', 'B'].downcase()
# downcase(['A', 'B'])
# ```
# Would both result in `['a', 'b']`
#
# @example Converting a Hash to lower case
# ```puppet
# {'A' => 'HEllO', 'B' => 'GOODBYE'}.downcase()
# ```
# Would result in `{'a' => 'hello', 'b' => 'goodbye'}`
#
# @example Converting a recursive structure
# ```puppet
# ['A', 'B', ['C', ['D']], {'X' => 'Y'}].downcase
# ```
# Would result in `['a', 'b', ['c', ['d']], {'x' => 'y'}]`
