# Change log
All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.
This project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/).

## [2.0.3]
### Summary:
Fixes an issue where gettext:setup tasks were being loaded in the wrong order within a module and causing the POT file to be created in the Puppet gem, not the module.

## [2.0.2]
### Summary:
Fixes an issue where the gettext rake tasks look in the spec\_helper and not the current module for the `locales/` directory.

## [2.0.1]
### Summary:
Fixes an issue where older puppets don't bring in the gettext gem requirement causing the psh rake tasks to fail.

### Fixed:
- Don't define gettext rake tasks if gettext library is not present

## [2.0.0]
### Summary:
This release makes the module working dir configurable, adds features for future puppet features, and updates the spec rake task for TravisCI

### Changed:
- The `release_tasks` rake task now calls `parallel_spec` instead of `spec`

### Added:
- Make `module_working_dir` configurable
- Check `type_aliases` directory for spec tests
- Locales support for i18n

### Fixed:
- Ensure /-only used on windows

## [1.2.2]
### Summary:

Dominic Cleal reported and fixed an issue with the STRICT_VARIABLES setting on puppet versions before 3.5.

## [1.2.1]
### Summary:

The previous release was taken down, as some optional gem dependencies slipped through into the gemspec, breaking builds using ruby 2.2 and earlier. This release updates the gem build process, so this should not happen again.

## [1.2.0] - 2016-08-23
### Summary:

Add a bunch of new features, and fix a bunch of annoying bugs: parallel test execution, default to strict variable checking on Puppet 4, code coverage, and rubocop tasks.

Thanks to all community contributors: Alexander Fisher, Alex Harvey, Chris Tessmer, David Moreno García, Dmitry Ilyin, Dominic Cleal, Federico Voges, Garrett Honeycutt, Leo Arnold, Matthew Haughton, Mickaël Canévet, and Rob Nelson.

### Added:

New tasks:
* Add code coverage for Ruby >= 1.9 using SimpleCov.
* Add a rubocop rake task.
* Use beaker:ssh to log into your running beaker machines.

Spec parallelization
* Add `parallel_spec` task to run specs in parallel.
* Use CI_NODE_TOTAL and CI_NODE_INDEX to split tests across nodes.

Fixtures improvements:
* Automatically symlink the module directory, if no symlink fixtures are specified.
* Add the `subdir` key to repository fixtures to only use a part of that repository.
* Set `FIXTURES_YML` environment variable to load fixtures from somewhere else than `.fixtures.yml`.

## Changed:
* Updated default excludes and rspec patterns.
* Updated default disabled lint checks to work with puppet-lint 2.0.0.
* Testing on Puppet 4 will now default to strict variable checking. Set STRICT_VARIABLES=no to disable.
* `PuppetInternals.scope` is now deprecated. Use the new `scope` property from rspec-puppet.
* beaker_nodes is now called beaker:sets.

### Fixed:
* Ignore symlinks inside .git when running check:symlinks rake task.
* Allow multiple invocations of spec_prep to run in parallel.
* Address a race condition when cloning multiple git fixtures.
* Restrict gem dependencies to work with ruby 1.9.
* Update verify_contents() to work with duplicates in the arguments.
