## [1.2.1]
### Summary:

The previous release was taken down, as some optional gem dependencies slipped through into the gemspec, breaking builds using ruby 2.2 and earlier. This release updates the gem build process, so this should not happen again.

## [1.2.0] - 2016-08-23
### Summary:

Add a bunch of new features, and fix a bunch of annoying bugs: parallel test execution, default to strict variable checking on Puppet 4, code coverage, and rubocop tasks.

Thanks to all community contributors: Alexander Fisher, Alex Harvey, Chris Tessmer, David Moreno García, Dmitry Ilyin, Dominic Cleal, Federico Voges, Garrett Honeycutt, Leo Arnold, Matthew Haughton, Mickaël Canévet, and Rob Nelson.

### Added:

New tasks:
* Add code coverage for Ruby >= 1.9 using SimpleCov.
* Add a rubocop rake task.
* Use beaker:ssh to log into your running beaker machines.

Spec parallelization

* Use CI_NODE_TOTAL and CI_NODE_INDEX to split tests across nodes.

Fixtures improvements:
* Automatically symlink the module directory, if no symlink fixtures are specified.
* Add the `subdir` key to repository fixtures to only use a part of that repository.
* Set `FIXTURES_YML` environment variable to load fixtures from somewhere else than `.fixtures.yml`.

## Changed:
* Updated default excludes and rspec patterns.
* Updated default disabled lint checks to work with puppet-lint 2.0.0.
* Testing on Puppet 4 will now default to strict variable checking. Set STRICT_VARIABLES=no to disable.

* beaker_nodes is now called beaker:sets.

### Fixed:
* Ignore symlinks inside .git when running check:symlinks rake task.
* Allow multiple invocations of spec_prep to run in parallel.
* Address a race condition when cloning multiple git fixtures.

* Update verify_contents() to work with duplicates in the arguments.
